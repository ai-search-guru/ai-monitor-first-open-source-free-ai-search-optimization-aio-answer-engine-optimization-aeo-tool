# 🔒 Security

Authentication: Firebase Auth with email/password and OAuth
Authorization: Role-based access control (RBAC)
Data Encryption: All data encrypted in transit and at rest
API Security: Rate limiting and request validation
Privacy: GDPR and CCPA compliant data handling

Security Best Practices
bash# Environment variables security
# Never commit .env files to version control
echo ".env.local" >> .gitignore

# Use strong secrets for NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)

# Regularly rotate API keys
# Monitor API usage for anomalies
📈 Performance Optimization
Built-in Optimizations

Code Splitting: Automatic chunking for faster load times
Image Optimization: Next.js Image component with WebP support
Caching: Redis-based caching for API responses
CDN: Global content delivery via Vercel Edge Network

Performance Monitoring
javascript// lib/performance.js
export function measurePerformance(name, fn) {
  const start = performance.now();
  const result = await fn();
  const end = performance.now();
  
  console.log(`${name} took ${end - start} milliseconds`);
  return result;
}
